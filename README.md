RoyalPortableOSeries
====================

A typeface based on a 1936 Royal Portable O-Series typewriter. The regular weight was created from an old, faded ribbon; the bold weight is a new, freshly-inked ribbon.

This is an initial version of the font; improvements will follow. The monospaced version in particular has not been thoroughly tested.

This font was originally created for Agant's Timeline World War 2 app for iPad. More information can be found at http://agant.com/ww2 .

The font is licensed under the SIL Open Font License. See OFL.txt for full details.
